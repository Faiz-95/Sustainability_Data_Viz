            <h2>Australia's Energy Generation, Consumption and Exports</h2>
            <p id="homepara1">
                -&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia is believed to have 46% of the world's uranium resources, 6% of coal resources, and 2% of natural gas resources. Australia, on the other hand, has only approximately 0.3 percent of the world's oil reserves. <br/><br/>
                -&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia produces roughly 2.4 percent of total global energy and is a key supplier of energy to international markets, exporting nearly A$80 billion worth of energy. <br/><br/>
                -&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia is the world's leading coal exporter. More over half of Australia's energy exports are coal. Australia is the world's sixth-largest exporter of uranium and sixth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In comparison, Australia imports more than half of its liquid fuel requirements. <br/><br/>
                -&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia is the world's twenty-first largest energy consumer and the fifteenth greatest in terms of per capita energy consumption.

            <h2>What are Renewable and Non-Renewable Sources of Energy?</h2>
            <p class="homepara2">
                <b>Renewable energy</b>, sometimes known as <b>clean energy</b>, is generated from naturally replenished sources or processes. Sunlight and wind, for example, continue to shine and blow despite the fact that their availability is dependent on time and weather. While renewable energy is frequently considered of as a new technology, it has long been utilized for heating, transportation, and lighting. However, during the last 500 years or so, people have become increasingly reliant on cheaper, dirtier energy sources like coal and natural gas.<br/><br>
                Renewables are becoming a more essential power source now that we have more creative and less expensive ways to capture and preserve wind and solar energy. Renewable energy is expanding at all scales, from rooftop solar panels on residences that can sell power back to the grid to massive offshore wind farms. As the usage of renewable energy grows, one of the most important goals will be to revamp Australia's power infrastructure, making it smarter, secure, and more integrated across regions.

            <p class="homepara2">
                Fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal are examples of <b>Non-Renewable, or "dirty," Energy</b>. Non-Renewable energy sources come in finite quantities and take a long time to replenish. Non-Renewable energy sources are also more common in certain parts of the world, making them more abundant in some countries than others. Prioritizing nonrenewable energy can also help to boost national security by lowering a country's reliance on fossil fuel exports.<br/><br>
                Many non-renewable energy sources are potentially hazardous to the environment and human health. Oil drilling, for example, may necessitate strip mining, fracking technology can cause earthquakes and water contamination, and coal power plants pollute the air. All of these actions, on top of that, contribute to global warming.
