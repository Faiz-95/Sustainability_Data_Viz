        <h2>Consumption of Energy</h2>
        <p class='graphinfo'>
            In this visualisation, we analyse the total quantity of energy consumed in Australia from 1980 to 2019. Here, we provided a breakdown of the fuel types consumed over the years. We were able to visualise accurate data by using the <a class='graphlink' href='https://www.energy.gov.au/publications/australian-energy-update-2021'>Australian Energy Update 2021 Report</a> from the Australian Government website as the data source for this infographic.<br><br>

            We have the time period in years on the x-axis and the amount of energy consumed in petajoules on the y-axis. By hovering over a fuel type in the legend, the area graph corresponding to that fuel type would have a different opacity, highlighting that fuel type while fading the others into the background. Additionally, brushing is added to the visualisation so that the viewer can zoom in on a particular time period. By double-clicking the graph, the default view will be restored.<br><br>

            Gigawatt hours, abbreviated as GWh, is a unit of energy representing one billion (1,000,000,000) watt hours and is equivalent to one million kilowatt hours. Gigawatt hours are often used as a measure of the output of large electricity power stations.
